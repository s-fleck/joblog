# joblog

<!-- badges: end -->

joblog proposes a format for logging the start and completion of jobs via
[lgr](https://github.com/s-fleck/lgr) (such as cron jobs or automatically 
triggered etl operations). joblog assumes you are logging to 
[jsonlines](http://jsonlines.org/) files, but other formats/logging destinations
could be supported in theory.



## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("s-fleck/joblog")
```

## Example

```{r example, width = 1000}
library(joblog)

# setup logging
lf <- paste0(tempfile(), ".jsonl")
lg <- lgr::get_logger("jobs")$set_propagate(FALSE)  # prevent logging to the console
lg$add_appender(lgr::AppenderJson$new(file = lf), name = "json")

lg$list_log(job_start("example"))  # log the job start
# ... do stuff ...
lg$list_log(job_finished())  # log the job end

# run the same job again
lg$list_log(job_start("example"))
lg$list_log(job_failed("something went wrong")) 


# log other stuff unrelated to the job
lg$info("today is tuesday")
lg$warn("only true every 7 days")
```

Using the setup above we have logged to a json lines file that looks like this:

```{r}
lg$appenders$json$show()
```

joblog provides `scrape_joblog()` for extracting the jobs from logfile and
consolidating all info about the job from the relevant log entries, based
on the auto-generated job-id.

```{r}
scrape_joblog(lf)
```


```
#cleanup
unlink(lf)

```
